.SYNOPSIS
    Portable version of Export-Permission with all ScriptModule dependencies rolled up into this single .ps1 file

    Create CSV, HTML, and XML reports of permissions

.DESCRIPTION
    Benefits:
    - Presents complex nested permissions and group memberships in a report that is easy to read
    - Provides additional information about each account such as Name, Department, Title
    - Multithreaded with caching for fast results
    - Works as a scheduled task
    - Works as a custom sensor script for Paessler PRTG Network Monitor (Push sensor recommended due to execution time)

    Supports these scenarios:
    - Local folder paths
    - UNC folder paths
    - DFS folder paths
    - Mapped network drives
    - Active Directory domain trusts
    - Unresolved SIDs for deleted accounts
    - Group memberships via the Primary Group as well as the memberOf property

    Does not support these scenarios:
    - ACL Owners or Groups (ToDo enhancement; for now only the DACL is reported)
    - File permissions (ToDo enhancement; for now only folder permissions are reported)
    - Share permissions (ToDo enhancement; for now only NTFS permissions are reported)

    Behavior:
    - Resolves each path in the TargetPath parameter
      - Local paths become UNC paths using the administrative shares, so the computer name is shown in reports
      - DFS paths become all of their UNC folder targets, including disabled ones
      - Mapped network drives become their UNC paths
    - Gets all permissions for the resolved paths
    - Gets non-inherited permissions for subfolders (if specified)
    - Exports the permissions to a .csv file
    - Uses ADSI to get information about the accounts and groups listed in the permissions
    - Exports information about the accounts and groups to a .csv file
    - Uses ADSI to recursively retrieve group members
      - Retrieves group members using both the memberOf and primaryGroupId attributes
      - Members of nested groups are retrieved as members of the group listed in the permissions.
          - Their hierarchy of nested group memberships is not retrieved (for performance reasons).
    - Exports information about all accounts with access to a .csv file
    - Exports information about all accounts with access to a report generated as a .html file
    - Outputs an XML-formatted list of common misconfigurations for use in Paessler PRTG Network Monitor as a custom XML sensor
.INPUTS
    [System.IO.DirectoryInfo[]] TargetPath parameter

    Strings can be passed to this parameter and will be re-cast as DirectoryInfo objects.
.OUTPUTS
    [System.String] XML output formatted for a Custom XML Sensor in Paessler PRTG Network Monitor
.NOTES
    This code has not been reviewed or audited by a third party

    This code has limited or no tests

    It was designed for presenting reports to non-technical management or administrative staff

    It is convenient for that purpose but it is not recommended for compliance reporting or similar formal uses

    ToDo bugs/enhancements: https://github.com/IMJLA/Export-Permission/issues
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -ExcludeAccount 'BUILTIN\\Administrator'

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Exclude the built-in Administrator account from the HTML report

    The ExcludeAccount parameter uses RegEx, so the \ in BUILTIN\Administrator needed to be escaped.

    The RegEx escape character is \ so the regular expression needed for the parameter is 'BUILTIN\\Administrator'
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -ExcludeAccount @(
        'BUILTIN\\Administrators',
        'BUILTIN\\Administrator',
        'CREATOR OWNER',
        'NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM'
    )

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Exclude from the HTML report:
    - The built-in Administrator account
    - The built-in Administrators group and its members (unless they appear elsewhere in the permissions)
    - The CREATOR OWNER security principal
    - The computer account (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)

    Note: CREATOR OWNER will still be reported as an alarm in the PRTG XML output
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -ExcludeClass @('computer')

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Include empty groups on the HTML report (rather than the default setting which would exclude computers and groups)
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -NoGroupMembers -ExcludeClass @('computer')

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test

    Do not spend time retrieving group members

    Include groups on the report, but exclude computers (rather than the default setting which would exclude computers and groups)
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -IgnoreDomain 'CONTOSO'

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Remove the CONTOSO domain prefix from associated accounts and groups
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -IgnoreDomain 'CONTOSO1','CONTOSO2'

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Remove the CONTOSO1\ and CONTOSO2\ domain prefixes from associated accounts and groups

    Across the two domains, accounts with the same samAccountNames will be considered equivalent

    Across the two domains, groups with the same Names will be considered equivalent
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -LogDir C:\Logs

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Redirect logs and output files to C:\Logs instead of the default location in AppData
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -LevelsOfSubfolders 0

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test only (no subfolders)
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -LevelsOfSubfolders 2

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test

    Only include subfolders to a maximum of 2 levels deep (C:\Test\Level1\Level2)
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath C:\Test -Title 'New Custom Report Title'

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder C:\Test and all subfolders

    Change the title of the HTML report to 'New Custom Report Title'
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace\DfsFolderWithTarget'

    The target path is a DFS folder with folder targets

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the DFS folder targets associated with this path
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace\DfsFolderWithoutTarget\DfsSubfolderWithoutTarget\DfsSubfolderWithTarget'

    The target path is a DFS subfolder with folder targets

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the DFS folder targets associated with this path
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace\DfsFolderWithoutTarget\DfsSubfolderWithoutTarget\DfsSubfolderWithTarget\Subfolder'

    The target path is a subfolder of a DFS subfolder with folder targets

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the DFS folder targets associated with this path
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\'

    This is an edge case that is not currently supported

    The target path is the root of an AD domain

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for ? Invalid/fail param validation?
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\computer.ad.contoso.com\'

    This is an edge case that is not currently supported

    The target path is the root of a server

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for ? Invalid/fail param validation?
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace'

    This is an edge case that is not currently supported

    The target path is a DFS namespace

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder on the DFS namespace server associated with this path

    Add a warning that they are permissions from the DFS namespace server and could be confusing
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace\DfsFolderWithoutTarget'

    This is an edge case that is not currently supported.

    The target path is a DFS folder without a folder target

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder on the DFS namespace server associated with this path

    Add a warning that they are permissions from the DFS namespace server and could be confusing
.EXAMPLE
    Export-Permission.ps1 -TargetPath '\\ad.contoso.com\DfsNamespace\DfsFolderWithoutTarget\DfsSubfolderWithoutTarget'

    This is an edge case that is not currently supported.

    The target path is a DFS subfolder without a folder target.

    Generate reports on the NTFS permissions for the folder on the DFS namespace server associated with this path

    Add a warning that they are permissions from the DFS namespace server and could be confusing

    .SYNOPSIS
    Use ADSI to lookup info about IdentityReferences from Authorization Rule Collections that came from Discretionary Access Control Lists
    .DESCRIPTION
    Based on the IdentityReference proprety of each Access Control Entry:
    Resolve SID to NT account name and vise-versa
    Resolve well-known SIDs
    Resolve generic defaults like 'NT AUTHORITY' and 'BUILTIN' to the applicable computer or domain name
    Add these properties (IdentityReferenceSID,IdentityReferenceName,IdentityReferenceResolved) to the object and return it
    .INPUTS
    [System.Security.AccessControl.AuthorizationRuleCollection]$InputObject
    .OUTPUTS
    [PSCustomObject] Original object plus IdentityReferenceSID,IdentityReferenceName,IdentityReferenceResolved, and AdsiProvider properties
    .EXAMPLE
    Get-Acl |
    Expand-Acl |
    Resolve-Ace

    Use Get-Acl from the Microsoft.PowerShell.Security module as the source of the access list
    This works in either Windows Powershell or in Powershell
    Get-Acl does not support long paths (>256 characters)
    That was why I originally used the .Net Framework method
    .EXAMPLE
    Get-FolderAce -LiteralPath C:\Test -IncludeInherited |
    Resolve-Ace
    .EXAMPLE
    [System.String]$FolderPath = 'C:\Test'
    [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]$DirectoryInfo = Get-Item -LiteralPath $FolderPath
    $Sections = [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Access -bor [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Owner
    $FileSecurity = [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity]::new($DirectoryInfo,$Sections)
    $IncludeExplicitRules = $true
    $IncludeInheritedRules = $true
    $AccountType = [System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]
    $FileSecurity.GetAccessRules($IncludeExplicitRules,$IncludeInheritedRules,$AccountType) |
    Resolve-Ace

    This uses .Net Core as the source of the access list
    It uses the GetAccessRules method on the [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity] class
    The targetType parameter of the method is used to specify that the accounts in the ACL are returned as SIDs
    .EXAMPLE
    [System.String]$FolderPath = 'C:\Test'
    [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]$DirectoryInfo = Get-Item -LiteralPath $FolderPath
    $Sections = [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Access -bor
    [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Owner -bor
    [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Group
    $DirectorySecurity = [System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity]::new($DirectoryInfo,$Sections)
    $IncludeExplicitRules = $true
    $IncludeInheritedRules = $true
    $AccountType = [System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]
    $FileSecurity.GetAccessRules($IncludeExplicitRules,$IncludeInheritedRules,$AccountType) |
    Resolve-Ace

    This uses .Net Core as the source of the access list
    It uses the GetAccessRules method on the [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity] class
    The targetType parameter of the method is used to specify that the accounts in the ACL are returned as NT account names (DOMAIN\User)
    .EXAMPLE
    [System.String]$FolderPath = 'C:\Test'
    [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]$DirectoryInfo = Get-Item -LiteralPath $FolderPath
    [System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity]$DirectorySecurity = $DirectoryInfo.GetAccessControl('Access')
    [System.Security.AccessControl.AuthorizationRuleCollection]$AuthRules = $DirectorySecurity.Access
    $AuthRules | Resolve-Ace

    Use the .Net Framework (or legacy .Net Core up to 2.2) as the source of the access list
    Only works in Windows PowerShell
    Those versions of .Net had a GetAccessControl method on the [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] class
    This method is removed in modern versions of .Net Core

    .EXAMPLE
    [System.String]$FolderPath = 'C:\Test'
    [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]$DirectoryInfo = Get-Item -LiteralPath $FolderPath
    $Sections = [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Access -bor [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlSections]::Owner
    $FileSecurity = [System.IO.FileSystemAclExtensions]::GetAccessControl($DirectoryInfo,$Sections)

    The [System.IO.FileSystemAclExtensions] class is a Windows-specific implementation
    It provides no known benefit over the cross-platform equivalent [System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity]

    Resolve SID to NT account name and vise-versa
    Resolve well-known SIDs
    Resolve generic defaults like 'NT AUTHORITY' and 'BUILTIN' to the applicable computer or domain name
    .INPUTS

        Expand an Access Control List into its constituent Access Control Entries

        Enumerate the members of the Access property of the $InputObject parameter (which is an AuthorizationRuleCollection or similar)
        Append the original ACL to each member as a SourceAccessList property
        Then return each member

        Use Get-Acl from the Microsoft.PowerShell.Security module as the source of the access list
        This works in either Windows Powershell or in Powershell
        Get-Acl does not support long paths (>256 characters)
        That was why I originally used the .Net Framework method

        .SYNOPSIS
            Prepend a prefix to a log message, write the message to an output stream, and write the message to a text file.
            Writes a message to a log file and/or PowerShell output stream
        .DESCRIPTION
            Prepends the log message with:
                a current timestamp
                the current hostname
                the current username
                the current command (function or file name)
                the current location (line number in the code)

            Tab-delimits these fields for a compromise between readability and parseability

            Adds the log message to either:
            * a hashtable (which can be thread-safe) using the timestamp as the key, which was passed to the $LogMsgCache parameter
            * a Global:$LogMessages variable which was created by the PsLogMessage module during import

    .Synopsis
        Split a command for a collection of input objects into multiple threads for asynchronous processing
    .Description
        The specified command will be run for each input object in a separate powershell instance with its own runspace
        These runspaces are part of the same runspace pool inside the same powershell.exe process
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates sending a Cmdlet name to the -Command parameter
            $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command 'Write-Output'
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates sending a scriptblock to the -Command parameter
            $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command [scriptblock]::create("Write-Output `$args[0]")
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates sending a script file path to the -Command parameter
            $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command "C:\Test-Command.ps1"
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates sending a function to the -Command parameter
            $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command 'Test-Function'
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates the -AddParam parameter

        $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command "Get-Service" -InputParameter ComputerName -AddParam @{"Name" = "BITS"}
    .EXAMPLE
        The following demonstrates the -AddSwitch parameter

        $InputObject | Split-Thread -Command "Get-Service" -AddSwitch @('RequiredServices','DependentServices')
	.EXAMPLE
		The following demonstrates the use of a threadsafe hashtable to store results
		The hastable can be accessed and updated from inside each runspace

		$ThreadsafeHashtable = [hashtable]::Synchronized(@{})
		$InputObject | Split-Thread -Command "Fake-Function" -InputParameter ComputerName -AddParam @{"ResultHashTableParameter" = $ThreadsafeHashtable}
